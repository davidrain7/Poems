Poems, Complete, All:  
========================
For Keppler, 2025.0607.1100: 

There is a bounded volume of a particular dimension 
Whose composition reminds me of holy instrumentation.  
A Floret of Six, in its foundation, does curiously mark 
The center & the origin of that common material's spark. 

Above, there is a legal scroll to declare all the realm's intention, 
& if it were peeled away, there would be left a sticky situation.  
For, under it are runes which join all the way around.  
Just as the ones at Stonehenge were planted in the ground.  

A temporal barrier separates these from the hemisphere above, 
Into which, was pressed the Form of Lightning by secret acts of love. 
Highest, all, is a space perpetually of gold 
Where Pattern-Maker watches all from countless ages old.   

Not one Design but many form this supernatural construction -- 
Only possible by each Patterns' interoperation.

Spectrum 1 of 2, 2025.0605.1100: 

He lit a candle, far away, which points in all direction 
& placed it in a dilated basket of gravitation -- 
To watch over all the Boundary land & thus illuminate; 
& as it burned its ovum compressed an egg of fire inside it.  

Within this swollen, molten orb of inconceivable dimension 
A litter of Photo s were born by energetic volition.  
Then they pounced out of that basket faster than an arrow 
& landed as a single beam through my cottage window. 

This patrols accross my floor with chronographic fealty.  
Then every evening, grinning wide, will ask about mortality, 
& ask if I am constant & near-massless where I go, 
Or ask if I am transparent with a rim of golden hue.  

But in that beam a sweet kitten sleeps & dreams of earthly wisdom 
While its body unfolds the beam like a biological prism.

Choreagos, 2025.0605.1616:  

To where could he have gone ?  To find a splendid view
Of a golden sunrise dispensed into the dew ?
Without a note or phrase, departing, he suddenly was gone.  
There, alone, I asked, bewildered, 'Was it something I had done ?'

If I had wings to fly away, I would go to find my friend.  
Into the Oasis blue, I would go, & sail upon the wind.  

The clouds below, I would rest upon, like tender moss in bloom.  
With radiant expectation, I would explore that heavenly room.  
I would ask the early Moon, still gathering her beam, 
If she had gone throughout the day & maybe seen my friend.  

As daylight melts into the color of lavender & light, 
I would climb upon the evening wind & search among the night.  

My heart aches, I cannot recall what it felt like to be well.  
Like having woken from a dream & on reflection cannot tell.
As night leaks in & wounds my soul, I struggle, then, to live. 
I reach up to the Atrium-Old for the starlight it gives.  

But, I cannot get the wings I need from the attic of my mind.  
I have no coins or valuable things to give away this time.  
All I can do is dream of him & hope that he is safe.  
Perhaps he found a friendly people in another place.  

As for me & Melancholy, we have grown so very close.  
When I dream of search again, he sits with me the most.  
Our meetings are supervised by our neighbor Father Time.  
With a Lantern & Orrery, he stares from the sublime.  

My friend & I would sit in the sunny park & talk, 
Or investigate the city space in a meandering kind of walk.  
Moving slowly as can be, to stay constantly immersed --
Painting in the daydreams with the word of every verse.  

But now, it seems, when I look around, only Melancholy is there -- 
Who hangs upon me like a shadow & saturates the air.  
I resign, one night, our correspondence, to sneak out of the place, 
But as I turned, a nearby window reflec'd a tender face.  
Clinging to my Ring-of-Hope -- that not a portrait kept.  
I confirmed a true reflection, then bitterly had wept.  
For, when I thought my friend had searched & found me through the pane, 
I now see my friend's face & mine are indistinguishably the same

Lighthouse, 2025.0604.0900:  

There is a house along the shore, built of clay & bur-ned orange.  
All the blocks of its Foundation creak & groan in woeful mourns.  
It was the ships which brought them in, while Masons drew the line. 
Guided into port by beacon -- of Luminary Divine.  

Living, weary, misaligned, & copiously marred -- 
They are, thoughtfully, fitted into frames of iron bar.  
Their thirst is dry as sand burning in the ember 
For a wonderous, woken, dream which mind cannot remember.  

Lingering, meandering, their supplication earnest 
For the city horn, or trumpet, to call them into service.  
Know, the walls of garden stone, in daylight do abound, 
Because the Builder dug them out from darkness underground.  

En Vividarium et intervigilium et viatoris
While in the Foundation, underground, the gifts to Azazel are weeping.
